# Champions_by_City

## Summary of Project
- The idea came from a friend posting an image of Championships won by City. Another friend chimed in, "This would be cool if it showed the last 30 years." So I chose to gather the championship winners and runner-ups for the four professional sports in America (Major League Baseball(MLB), National Football League(NFL), National/American Basketball Association(NBA/ABA), the National Hockey League(NHL)), and group them by city and show many titles they've won and lost in each city.

### Data Sources

- The data was pulled from 

  - baseballreference.com 
  - Wikipedia for basketball and hockey
  - ESPN.com for the Super Bowl (NFL)

- The data contains only NHL, NFL (in the Super Bowl Era anything before this was excluded), MLB, and the NBA and ABA eras. 

### Cleaning and Changing of the Data.

- The data was cleaned from the tables they were imported from which involved 
  - separating scores into teams of winners and losers.
  - stripping dates into years only.
  - getting rid of team nicknames.

- Many teams who use the state or a nickname instead of using the direct city were changed. The following changes were made.
 
- NFL
  - New England to Boston
  - Carolina to Charlotte
  - Arizona to Phoenix
  - Tennessee to Nashville
  - Minnesota to Minneapolis

- MLB
  - Arizona to Phoenix
  - Texas to Dallas
  - Minnesota to Minneapolis
  - Florida to Miami
- NHL
  - Carolina to Charlotte
  - Florida to Miami
  - Minnesota to Minneapolis
- NBA/ABA
  - Golden State to San Francisco
  - Indiana to Indianapolis


### Links to Visualization

- Currently I have two visualizations that allow you to see how many titles a city has won or lost. 

  - [The first is a dashboard where you can filter by years and league to see how successful a city has been](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/peytonarana/viz/WinnersandRunner-upsbyCity/Winners)

  - [The second allows you to see how successful a city has been by sport, what years they've won or lost the championship, and the city winning percentage.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/peytonarana/viz/ChampionshipAppearancesbyCity/CityAppearances)

### Future Plans

- The goal with future updates is to include the ability to filter by league and year in tableau.

- The ability to compare two cities and the ability to filter by league and year.

- Possible grouping of state/province as well.
